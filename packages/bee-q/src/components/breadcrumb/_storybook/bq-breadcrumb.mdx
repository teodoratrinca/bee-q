#Breadcrumb

A breadcrumb or breadcrumb trail is a graphical control element used as a navigational aid in user interfaces and on web pages. It allows users to keep track and maintain awareness of their locations within programs, documents, or websites.

## Usage

A breadcrumb trail tracks and displays each page viewed by a visitor of a website, either in the order the pages were viewed, or in other definitions, displaying a hierarchy of the current page in relation to the website's structure. Breadcrumbs are typically placed in horizontal form under the masthead or navigation of a website.

## üëç When to use

They are especially useful when users arrive to the site through an external link and don't start with the homepage.

## Variations

1. Location or Hierarchy Based Breadcrumbs
   Location or Hierarchy based breadcrumb navigation is the type you'll come across most often. A location based breadcrumb shows the user the current page they are on and its relation to the website's hierarchy above it. Think of it like the folders where you store documents on your computer. The first folder is the most broad and each folder within gets more specific until you arrive at your document.

2. Path or History Based Breadcrumbs
   Path based breadcrumb navigation represents the unique path a user took before arriving on the current page. Although the path is not typically displayed in its entirety, path based breadcrumbs are often implemented as a form of back button, which brings the user to the previous page of their visit.

## Properties

3. Attribute Based Breadcrumbs
   Attribute based breadcrumbs display the attributes or tags a user has selected in order to filter their search on a webpage
